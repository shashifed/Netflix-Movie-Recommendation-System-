A recommendation system, or recommender system tries to make predictions on user preferences and make recommendations which should interest customers.


There are basically two approaches to make recommendations:

1.Content-based filtering

2.Collaborative filtering (or social filtering)

Content-based methods gives recommendations based on the similarity of two movie contents or attributes while collaborative methods make a prediction on posible preferences using a matrix with ratings on different songs.



**Brief Idea on Content Based Filtering**

Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.


**Advantages of Content Based Filtering** 

1.No data from other users is required to start making recommendations.

2.Recommendations are highly relevant to the user.

3.Recommendations are transparent to the user.

4.Content-based filtering systems are generally easier to create.
