There are basically two approaches to make recommendations:

1.Collaborative filtering (or social filtering)

2.Content-based filtering

Content-based methods gives recommendations based on the similarity of two movie contents or attributes while collaborative methods make a prediction on posible preferences using a matrix with ratings on different songs.
